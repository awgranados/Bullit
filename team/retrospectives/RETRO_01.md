## Retro Assessment

I used the Start/Stop/Continue retro template. Each team member wrote down the things they think should start/stop/continue using the Retrospected website and voted on them and then explained why they think so.

This reto went pretty well. All team members shared about their reflection for the team to improve upon. These opinions are very helpful in improving the efficiency of teamwork. 

My advice to the next person leading a retro is to come up with a main topic at the start of the retro meeting. This may help the teammates to better reflect.
