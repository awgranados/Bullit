# Date of Retrospective: 11/15/23

* Led by: Hao Wu
* Present: Aditya Patil, Alexander Granados, Ricardo Hinojosa, Hao Wu
* Absent: Stanley Su

## Experiment
Currently, we don't think we are working efficiently enough.
For experiment, we would hold a coding session to work together to promote efficiency to see how that works.

### Outcome
The team met in the library Friday Nov 17th, from 11:00 to 13:00. The team discussed on the project and make it clear what each of the member should be working on.
- Stanley is working on the UI design
- Aditya is working on the app icon and modifiying the creating ride offer database
- Ricardo is working on the login database
- Hao is working on modifying the inputs for the creating ride offer
- Alex is working on the user profile page

The meeting went well and we had efficient discussions about our progress to the final product of our app.

## Optional
Here's the team's refelection about things to start/stop/continue:
### Start
* Working on different parts of the app to move toward the final product
* brainstorming ideas for the final product
* working on new issues to get closer to final product
* Add a file that specifies common UX/dependencies/details that can be shared and is the same for everyone in the team

### Stop
* Making PRs without letting others know
* lack of communication about final product

### Continue
* finalizing the logic for accepting/posting rides and offers
* updating group about features that youâ€™re working on
* Communicating and moving towards the final product
* Finding better ways to improve the app

## Retro Assessment

I used the Start/Stop/Continue retro template. Each team member wrote down the things they think should start/stop/continue using the Retrospected website and voted on them and then explained why they think so.

This reto went pretty well. All team members shared about their reflection for the team to improve upon. These opinions are very helpful in improving the efficiency of teamwork.
