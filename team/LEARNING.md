## Description:
Over the course of our project, we will be using the following technologies: Git, GitHub, Recat Native, JavaScript.
Hopefully, by the end of this project, everyone will have learned many new skills as well as either learning or improving with the technologies.
Below is a table of our teams familiarity with each technology on a scale of 1 to 5 at the *beginning* of the project, which 1 stands for zero or little knowledge and 5 stands for expert.  

## Table:
| Name      | Git/GitHub | React Native | JavaScript  |

| Alexander | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| Ricardo   | 3 | 1 | 3 |
