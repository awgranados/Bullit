## Scribed Discussion:

- Discussed the MVP feedbacks

## Suggested improvements from other groups
- After login, users can go back to the login page by simply swipe right/left. Maybe improve the logic here and add a log out button.
  - To resolve this, we will prevent user from swiping right/left to go back to the login page and add a log out button in our user profile page.
- When user click “”sign up”“, the login page is cut off (cannot see the first name)
  - Currently, we don't see this problem occuring on our side.
- Can’t scroll down the page (ex. cannot see Ride4). Maybe add scroll function.
  - To resolve this, we will add scorll functions to passenger/driver page.
- Limit the input as a number for price
  - To resolve this, we will add limitation to the price and other inputs to allow only certain types of input.
- Add function of editing request
  - To resolve this, we will add function of allowing users to edit their requests/offers.
- The tab page doesn’t save current status when switch to other tab page
  - To resolve this, we will modify the pages to allow user to keep current status when switching to other tab pages.
 
### Some other areas of improvements:
- Search and filter
  - We will be adding functions for users to search and filter certain locations.
- User profile/Review
  - We will add a user profile page and review page.
- Chat
  - We are looking into adding a chat functions to allow communication between users.
- Payment
  - We are looking into adding a payment page that shows up (But not functioning).
- Safety/Driver verification
  - We are looking into just allowing ucsb email sign up and log in.
- Map/Visualization/Real-time location tracker
  - Map is a good idea. But it's less important comparing to other features, we will work on the map after we finish other features.
- UI/UX Improvement
  - We will look at other apps' UI design and get some ideas on UI improvements.
