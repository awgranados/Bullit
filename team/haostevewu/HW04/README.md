## Evaluation method: A/B Testing
To choose a better design for the ride offer creation confirmation page, I made two designs (one of pop up window, and one of new page) to survey on my friends using Google Form (https://forms.gle/1v3QNqcXUs5stp1Q6).
### Survey format
The survey first asks the survee to rate on the design of the input page on a scale of 1 to 5 and explain the reason. Then they survey asks the survee to pick which of the two designs they like better and explain why.
### Result of the survey
The result of the survey is recorded in SurveyResult.md
