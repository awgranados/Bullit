Many students do not have a car and sometimes must travel long distances; eg. between towns. 
Carpooling is an eco-friendly way of traveling. We wish to explore making an app where students driving to another town can post their rides (date and time of departure) and students who do not own a car can join the carpool and pay the fuel fee for the ride. 
We aim to provide users with a safe, eco-friendly, and efficient way of traveling longer distances.
