Many students do not have a car and sometimes must travel long distances; eg. between towns. 
Carpooling is an eco-friendly way of traveling. We wish to explore making an app where students driving to another town can post their rides (date and time of departure) and students who do not own a car can join the carpool and pay the fuel fee for the ride. 
We aim to provide users with a safe, eco-friendly, and efficient way of traveling longer distances.

# Example Problem Scenario

A UCSB student wants to travel back to the Bay Area to visit their family for Thanksgiving. However, the student does not have a car and did not plan far enough ahead to buy an affordable plane ticket. By using our app, the student is able to quickly and cheaply find a carpool ride to make it back home for the holidays.
